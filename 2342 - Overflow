/*For example, if a computer can only represent numbers less than 1023 and we tell it to run the count 1022 + 5, it will overflow.
Given the largest number a computer can represent and an expression for adding or multiplying two integers, determine whether an overflow will occur.
Prohibited
The input contains a single set of tests, which must be read from the standard input device (usually the keyboard).
The first line of the input contains an integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 500,000) representing the largest number the computer can represent. The second line contains an integer P (0 ≤ P ≤ 1000), followed by a blank space, followed by a C character (which can be '+' or '*', representing the addition and multiplication operators, respectively), followed by a blank, followed by another integer Q (0 ≤ Q ≤ 1000). This line represents the expression P + Q , if the C character is '+', or P × Q , if the C character for ‘*’.*/
