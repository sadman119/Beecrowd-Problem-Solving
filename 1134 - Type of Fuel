// Type of Fuel

// A gas station wants to determine which of their products is the preference of their customers. Write a program to read the type of fuel supplied (coded as follows: 1. Alcohol 2. Gasoline 3. Diesel 4. End). If you enter an invalid code (outside the range of 1 to 4) a new code must be requested. The program will end when the inserted code is the number 4.
#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
       int code = 0, alcohol = 0, gasolin = 0, diesel = 0;

        while (code != 4) {
            scanf("%d", &code);
            if (code == 1) {
                alcohol= alcohol+1 ;
            }else if (code == 2) {
                gasolin = gasolin + 1;
            }else if (code == 3) {
                diesel = diesel + 1;
            }

        }

        printf("MUITO OBRIGADO\n");
        printf("Alcool: %d\n", alcohol);
        printf("Gasolina: %d\n", gasolin);
        printf("Diesel: %d\n", diesel);
